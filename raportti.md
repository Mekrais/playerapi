# Usage of AI

I used AI (ChatGPT) to help during this project, mainly by asking for examples and explanations, like help on structuring the SQLModel models, how SQLModel relationships work, error handling, and general advice when I got occasionally momentarily stuck.
I also have GitHub Copilot in my code editor, but I only really use it for autocompleting short syntax.
I didn't copy full solutions but asked for advice and then wrote and adjusted the code myself to fit the project requirements.
I also tested everything myself to make sure it worked and made sense.
